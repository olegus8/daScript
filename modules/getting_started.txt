0. Install new 3... Python (I've tested 3.8.6)

1. Update submodules

git submodule update

2. pip install conan

make sure conan is visible from the command line, i.e. path to python scripts is there
pip will warn you during install and give the correct path

3. cd modules\dasVulkan
conan install .

4. download and install https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#sdk/downloadConfirm/1.2.162.0/windows/VulkanSDK-1.2.162.0-Installer.exe
later ones may work too?

5. download and isntall LLVM 11 https://releases.llvm.org/download.html
later ones may work?
needs clang.exe in path

beware of configure under vscode, it may pick-up wrong clang.exe
